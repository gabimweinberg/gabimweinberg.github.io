	<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>
	
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://www.mechonhadar.org" target="_blank">Mechon Hadar's website</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.globalonenessproject.org" target="_blank">The Global Oneness Project</a></li>
		</ul>

	<h2>What did I like and dislike:</h2>
		<p>I liked Mechon Hadar's site because it (1) - has everything on the front page with links to go to the important pages that they have to offer, and (2) they clearly follow the concept of breaking the page into parts.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, I thought there were a couple of things to be desired in the design: (1)- the search bar is not ideal in it's functionality because of discrepancies in the way to spell things, (2)the site is a bit busy and makes it hard to get through everything, and (3) the images aren't all clickable to get to an "about us" page.</p>
		<p>I liked the Global Oneness Project because 1) They do a great job having the user zone in on one picture to click on it. 2) The pictures are clickable to other programs or videos, which is helpful 3) The breakdown of the page is symettrical, i think that it's a good use of the space and after gettign the first blast there are a few great breakdowns that work nicely.</p>
		<p>I wasn't a huge fan of the site's color</p>
